   ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
   ```

8. Build the plugin project with updated `graphql-java-codegen` library.

   # Build Gradle plugin
   ./gradlew -p plugins/gradle/graphql-java-codegen-gradle-plugin clean build
   
   # Build Maven plugin
   mvn clean verify -f plugins/maven/graphql-java-codegen-maven-plugin/pom.xml
   ```
