## Development process

Please follow the steps below in order to make the changes:

1. Clone the repository and open it in your favourite IDE.
2. Make code changes to the core library of `graphql-java-codegen`.
3. If changes are required in the plugin code, then **build** and **install** `graphql-java-codegen` first.

   ```shell script
   # This will install the library (including your recent changes) in your local maven repository.
   ./gradlew clean install
   ```
   
4. Build the plugin project with updated `graphql-java-codegen` library.

   ```shell script
   # Build Gradle plugin
   cd plugins/graphql-java-codegen-gradle-plugin/graphql-codegen-gradle-plugin
   ./gradlew clean build
   
   # Build Maven plugin
   cd plugins/graphql-java-codegen-maven-plugin
   mvn clean verify 
   ```

5. Make changes to the plugin code
6. Install the plugin (copy to your local maven repository).

   ```shell script
   # Install Gradle plugin
   cd plugins/graphql-java-codegen-gradle-plugin/graphql-codegen-gradle-plugin
   ./gradlew clean install
   
   # Install Maven plugin
   cd plugins/graphql-java-codegen-maven-plugin
   mvn clean install 
   ```

7. Make sure that `example` project is compiling and running.
